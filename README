XCB extension wrangler
======================


XCB extension wrangler (XCBEW) is a cross-platform open-source C/C++ extension
loading wrangler. It allows to avoid application to be linked against XCB
libraries by doing runtime open of dynamic libraries. This allows to have
software which can gracefully handle situations when XCB libraries are not
installed on the system. The usecases of this are:

- Software which can either run in headed and headless mode. Using this
  wrangler allows to run software on compute farms of all sorts.

- Detect which XCB or other GUI protocol to use. It might be Wayland or even
  something more obscure.

LIMITATIONS
===========

- Requires original headers at compile time.
